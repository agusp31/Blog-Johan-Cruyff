    </div>
    <h2>Beginnings as a coach</h2>
    <img src="imagenes/johan entrenador2.jpg" alt="" ><p>After retiring from playing, Cruyff followed in the footsteps of his mentor Rinus Michels, coaching a young Ajax side to victory in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1987 (1–0). In May and June 1985, Cruyff returned to Ajax again. 
      In the 1985–86 season, the league title was lost to Jan Reker's PSV.</p>
      <p>It was during this period as manager that Cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formation which consists of three mobile defenders; plus one more covering space, becoming, in effect,
         a defensive midfielder (from Rijkaard, Blind, Silooy, Verlaat, Larsson, Spelbos), two "controlling" midfielders (from Rijkaard, Scholten, Winter, Wouters, Mühren, Witschge) with responsibilities to feed the attack-minded players, one second striker (Bosman, Scholten), 
        two touchline-hugging wingers (from Bergkamp, van't Schip, De Wit, Witschge) and one versatile centre forward (from Van Basten, Meijer, Bosman). 
        So successful was this system that Ajax won the Champions League in 1995 playing Cruyff's system a tribute to Cruyff's legacy as Ajax coach</p>
        <h2>Coach of FC Barcelona</h2>
        <p>After having appeared for the club as a player, Cruyff returned to Barcelona for the 1988–89 season, this time to take up his new role as coach of the first team. 
          Before returning to Barcelona, however, Cruyff had already built up plenty of experience as a coach/manager. In the Netherlands, 
          he was strongly praised for the attacking flair he imposed on his sides and also for his commendable work as talent spotter.</p>
          <p>With Barça, Cruyff started work with a completely remodelled side after the previous season's scandal, 
            known as the "Hesperia Mutiny" ("El Motí de l'Hespèria" in Catalan). His second in command was Carles Rexach, who had already been at the club for a year.
          His second in command was Carles Rexach, who had already been at the club for a year.
          Cruyff immediately had his Barça charges playing his attractive brand of football and the results did not take long in coming.
          But, this did not just happen with the first team, the youth teams also displayed that same attacking style, something that made it easier for reserve players to make the switch to first team football.
          <br>As Sid Lowe noted, when Cruyff took over as manager, Barcelona of the late 1980s "were a club in debt and in crisis. Results were bad, performances were worse, 
          the atmosphere terrible and attendances down, while even the relationship between the president of the club Josep Lluís Núñez and the president of the Spanish autonomous community they represented, Jordi Pujol, had deteriorated. 
          It did not work immediately but he (Cruyff) recovered the identity he had embodied as a player. He took risks, and rewards followed."</p>
          <p>At Barça, Cruyff brought in players such as Pep Guardiola, José Mari Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Andoni Goikoetxea, Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Romário, Gheorghe Hagi and Hristo Stoichkov. With Cruyff, Barça experienced a glorious era. 
            In the space of five years (1989–1994), he led the club to four European finals (two European Cup Winners' Cup finals and two European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals). 
            Cruyff's track record includes one European Cup, four Liga championships, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Copa del Rey and four Supercopa de España</p>
          <p>Under Cruyff, Barça's "Dream Team" won four La Liga titles in a row (1991–1994), and beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 European Cup Winners' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley Stadium.
            On 10 May 1989, goals from Salinas and López Rekarte led Barcelona to a 2–0 victory against Sampdoria. Over 25,000 supporters travelled to Switzerland to support the team. Cruyff's new Barça took home the club's third Cup Winners' Cup. 
            The European Cup dream became a reality on 20 May 1992 at Wembley in London, when Barça beat Sampdoria. 
            Cruyff's last instruction to his players before they stepped onto the pitch was "Salid y disfrutad" (Spanish for "Go out and enjoy it" or "Go out there and enjoy yourselves")</p>
          <p>The legacy that Cruyff gave Barcelona, however, was about more than just trophies and records, as he gave Barça a winning mentality and footballing identity/ideology that runs through the club till this day. As Barcelona manager, 
              he laid systemic foundations for a prominent school of football: "Barçajax school" or "Barça–Ajax school", as it has been termed by many. 
              The predominant style of play, now known as tiki-taka or tiqui-taca, had been transferred and improved from Ajax to Barça.
            <p>In his autobiography, Cruyff explained why he made a set of 14 basic rules, which are displayed at every Cruyff Court in the world,
              "My fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow. They are there to teach young people that sports and games can also be translated into everyday life."
                He listed his 14 basic rules that include:<ol>
                <li>Team player – 'To accomplish things, you have to do them together.'</li>
                <li>Responsibility – 'Take care of things as if they were your own.'</li>
                <li>Respect – 'Respect one another.'</li>
                <li>Integration – 'Involve others in your activities.';</li>
                <li>Initiative – 'Dare to try something new.'</li>
                <li>Coaching – 'Always help each other within a team.'</li>
                <li>Personality – 'Be yourself.'</li>
                <li>Social involvement – 'Interaction is crucial, both in sport and in life.'</li>
                <li>Technique – 'Know the basics.'</li>
                <li>Tactics – 'Know what to do.'</li>
                <li>Development – 'Sport strengthens body and soul.'</li>
                <li>Learning – 'Try to learn something new every day.'</li>
                <li>Play together – 'An essential part of any game.'</li>
                <li>Creativity – 'Bring beauty to the sport.</li>
              </ol></p>
              <h3><img src="imagenes/Barca campeon champions.jpg" style: width="500" height="300">"Winning is just one day, a reputation can last a lifetime. Winning is an important thing, but to have your own style, to have people copy you, to admire you, that is the greatest gift."
                — Johan Cruyff</h3>
              <p>Cruyff always considered aesthetic and moral aspects of the game; it is not just about winning, but about winning with "right" style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. 
                The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. 
                As he once noted, "Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring"</p>
