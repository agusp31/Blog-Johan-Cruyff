        <h2>Biography of Johan Cruyff</h2>
        <p>Hendrik Johannes "Johan" Cruyff was born on 25 April 1947 in Amsterdam, on a street five minutes away from Ajax's stadium, his first football club. 
          Johan was the second son of Hermanus Cornelis Cruijff and Petronella Bernarda Draaijer, from a humble, working-class background in east Amsterdam. Cruyff, encouraged by his influential football-loving father and his close proximity in Akkerstraat to the De Meer Stadium, played football with his schoolmates and older brother, Henny, whenever he could, and idolised the prolific Dutch dribbler, Faas Wilkes.</p>
          <p>In 1959, Cruyff's father died from a heart attack. His father's death had a major impact on his mentality. 
          As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, "My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept stronger over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive." Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. 
          His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.</p>
          <p>Cruyff joined the youth development squad of Amsterdam’s Ajax soccer club when he was 10 years old. 
          He was 17 when he made his debut with the senior team. After helping Ajax win six league titles, four national cups, and three European Champion Clubs’ Cups (now known as the UEFA [Union of European Football Associations] Champions League), he was transferred to FC Barcelona in 1973. Captained by Cruyff, Barcelona won the Spanish League championship in 1974 and was runner-up in 1976 and 1977.</p>
          <p>Wearing the number 14 jersey since 1970, (except at Barcelona where was assigned number 9) Cruyff set a trend by players to, if allowed, choose a jersey number outside the usual starting line-up of one to eleven. In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and came second behind Pelé in their World Player of the Century poll.</p>
          <p>He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century. He was included in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.</p>
          <p>Considered to be one of the most influential figures in football history, Cruyff's style of play and football philosophy has influenced managers and players alike. Ajax and Barcelona are among the clubs that have developed youth academies based on Cruyff's coaching methods.</p>
          <p>His coaching philosophy helped lay the foundations for the revival of Ajax's international successes in the 1990s, and Spanish football's successes at both club and international levels during the years 2008 to 2012 have been cited as evidence of Cruyff's impact on contemporary football. And in Johan Neeskens's own words, "If you look at the greatest players in history, most of them couldn't coach. If you look at the greatest coaches in history, most of them were not great players. 
          Johan Cruyff did both and in such an exhilarating style.</p>
